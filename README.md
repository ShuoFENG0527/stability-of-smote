# stability-of-smote
Investigate the stability of SMOTE and propose a series of stable SMOTE-based oversampling techniques.
Stable SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN are implemented. Original SMOTE are implemented using the package named imlearn. To meet our requirement to run SMOTE, ADASYN and Borderline-SMOTE under the defect raio equalling 0.6, we have modified the package. 
Datasets collected from PROMISE are also uploaded. The datasets whose defect ratio is less than 40% are adopted in our study.
